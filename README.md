# Gamee Emulator

The [GAMEE Emulator tool](http://emulator.gameeapp.com/) helps developers to develop and test games within the Gamee-JS framework. The Emulator Tool is not connected to any backend. It should work as replica of the web platform.

The Emulator Tool is only published on our website. Its source code is currently not part of this repository.

## Features

The Emulator Tool mirrors some of the functionality of our web platform. For example: 

 - allows you to test games both running locally and remotely
 - basic game flow features, game initialization, game start, game restart
 - pause/resume
 - mockuping save state
 - mockuping replay
 - mockuping ghost mode
 - share via link
